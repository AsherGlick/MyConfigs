Upload Key
----------

This script takes advantage of the github API to allow a user to run a simple script, have the computer generate a new ssh keypair and then upload the pubkey to the github account.  
Simply run `addKey.sh` in order to upload your pub key, if you do not have an ssh keypair you will be prompted to generate one. Fill in your github username and password allong with the computer name you want github to accociate this key with.
